	<p>Week 2 technical blog:</p>
	<p>The differences between margins, border, and padding:</br>The difference between those is:</br>Margins are outside the box.</br>Borders simply draw a line around the area considered the div dashed or solid colors.</br>Padding is inside the box between the text and the edge. </p>
	<p>Best practices when using classes vs ids:</p>
	<p>Classes are more widely appliccable, id's are unique and more specific. Giving and id is like naming one human being, and classes are more of a demographic label in that regard. Many different people can be in the same class, but my driver's license only represents me in the whole world.</p></br>
	<p>The differences between relative, aboslute, and fixed positioning:</br>Fixed means that as the page scrolls, the element remains in the same place on the screen AS YOU SCROLL. It follows the 'viewport' meaning it is constantly on the screen and cannot be escaped through scrolling in any direction.</br>Absolute is the most straightforward. Pros: it goes EXACTLY where you tell it to go. Cons: it no longer cares about where any of the other elements on the page are or are trying to be.</br>Relative is the squirreliest positioning. When you tell relative positioning to offset by a number of pixels, it moves away from where it would otherwise naturally sit. By naturally, i mean that all relative elements try to flow to the top left, and politely make room for other relative elements.</p>
	<p>What it means to display blocks vs inline blocks: Blocks will fill the screen to the edge despite its content, while inline elements will only consume the space they need to display the entirety of their text/content.</br>Blocks by default consume the entire line as well as making a new line before and after itself.</p>
