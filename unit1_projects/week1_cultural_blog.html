	There was only one word in that giant pile that really caught my eye: Harmony.
	In music, the melody is the most prominent line of notes in the song at the time, usually the loudest.
        It is the part that is being showcased by the rest of the parts: the bass and the harmony.
	My point is that the harmony ties it all together, while not being enough to rule on its own, like a nice rug.
	People are not music though, and what I'm getting at is that its awesome when people work together as a team. Working as a cook 
	required teamwork as second nature, and playing music over half my life taught me 
	the importance of the middle roles in life. So my actual point is that I, for one, can take one for the team and not be in 
	charge all the time, and I think the people that are willing to be lead, the easier a time the leaders will have leading.
