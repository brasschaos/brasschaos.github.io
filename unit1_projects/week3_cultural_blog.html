<h2>Describeing a Time I dealt with Conflict</h2>
<h4>by Jared_C</h4>
</div>

<div id="content_area">
	<p>One thing I have learned about conflict is that it takes two or more people to create one. With only one person in a conflict, no real solution can be found since no conflict can be created without at least a second person to disagree. So identifying that conflict is present(to everyone involved) is a step towards the solution in itself, as well as likely the most difficult part.</p>
	<p>As far as personal experience on the subject, my capital tactic has been to simply remove myself from the equation as tactfully as possible. If its me against someone else over something I dont actually care about compared to having to hurt someone to get it, theyre usually willing and I'm not so they win. I'm excluding intentional competition like sports and video games, only talking about potential verbal and physical conflicts with people over differences of opinion. Not that it doesn't happen in games, but it different. IRL, people are willing to forgive each other just to continue being friends or stay in their lives. Anonymity + audience DESTROYS that.</p>
	<p>Anyway like I was saying, my history in conflict has been to let the immediate issue go because its usually meaningless. In cases when it is, when I'm going to fight for what i believe, I can't be satisfied until I'm certain we understand each other clearly. If there is somehow still conflict, I'll agree to disagree. If there is STILL conflict that needs to be acted on, well, I'm not much for fighting. If people can't be calm they can't think straight, and a threat of physical violence just tells me that they have nothing left. At that point I decide I'm satisfied, and I win because they're out of things to say, and the rest just works itself out...</p>
	<p>Conflict is certainly a strange thing, and out of the thousands of ways to perceive it, I chose to focus on interpersonal conflict and fighting. I just feel the most unique in that facet of conflict, I suppose.</p>
