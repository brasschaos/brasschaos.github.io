	<p><a href =""i love XKCD.</p>
	<p>After googling "sanitizing database inputs" i stumbled upo <a href="http://bobby-tables.com">bobby-tables.com</a>, further asserting that the number of times XKCD is referenced in a day world wide is absurdly high. The idea of "injecting", i guess, first dawned on me when I was pretty young, maybe even single digits. Seeing the name come back strangely when i entered slashes and symbols for character names in games let me kow it was real, and the fact that sometimes it still works today is incredible to me. In fallout 3 a character was named" :) " and the autosave fucntion was broken for that toon only due to the special character in the name made possible by the xbox keyboard but not the game's internals. Considering how possible it is for these oversights to be common in professional programming by sheer volume of products produced worldwide, things like heartbleed seem like they should be more of a surprise when they happen(and i hear about them anyway).</p>
