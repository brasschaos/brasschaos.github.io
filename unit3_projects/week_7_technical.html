	<p>After googling "sanitizing database inputs" I found <a href="http://bobby-tables.com">bobby-tables.com</a>, further asserting that the number of times XKCD is referenced in a day world wide is absurdly high. The idea of "injecting" code, I guess, first dawned on me when I was pretty young, maybe even single digits. Seeing the name come back strangely when I entered slashes and symbols for character names in games let me know it was real, and the fact that sometimes it still works today is incredible to me. In fallout 3 a character was named" :) " and the autosave fucntion was broken for that toon only due to the special character in the name made possible by the xbox keyboard, but not the game's internals. Considering how likely it is for oversights of this nature to be in professional programming based on the sheer volume of programs produced, things like heartbleed seem like they should be more common. By which I mean the manipulation of code, computer behaivor, and predictable outputs when it comes to programs designed for use by many, many people. Seriously, if Anonymous can <a target='blank' href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19633_5-most-satisfying-tales-payback_p2.html">wipe Aaron Barr's Ipad remotely</a> upon provocation, something must be making computing <em>against</em> the man more attractive than computing <em>for</em> the man.</p>
