	<p>Enumerable#cycle</p>
	<p>Ruby-doc says it loops over every element in the variable infinitely, unless a positive integer is provided as an argument. Very similar to #each, but it can be set to roll more then once. Sounds like a good tool for making a code cipher or something.</p>

	<p>Ruby vs. Javascript</p>
	<p>So far through my exposure, Ruby is more of a strucure and framework behind-the-scenes oriented language, considering all the flexability. Javascript seems more for manipulating simple objects, making pretty animations, and other front end content that ruby is functionally distinct from by design. By that I mean that javascript is much more specific and articulate, allowing for very specific actions on a smaller scale than ruby is meant for. The fact that the Js console is present in the dev tools shows how much more of a utility Js is meant to be, as opposed to the scaffolding and foundation that ruby was meant to create.</p>
