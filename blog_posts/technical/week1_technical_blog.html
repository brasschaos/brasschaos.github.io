	<p>First p0st!</br></br>My 3 favorite websites: <a href="http://www.Phong.com" target="_blank">phong.com</a> ,<a href="http://www.turntable.fm" target="_blank">turntable.fm</a>, <a href="http://www.superbad.com" target="_blank">superbad.com</a></br></br>    Each of these sites has(or had) something amazing about them that caught my attention more than just visually.</br></br>    Phong.com is an intense, engaging place where mad flash skills are on display. Various "trip machines" and other visualizations that I have not seen anywhere else on the web continue. Each visit serves to remind me that flash is an amazing tool that I will probably never understand as well as the people who crafted this site. At least now I have a system capable of keeping up with the complexity involved with some of the animations.</br></br>    Turntable.fm was my magic alternative to pandora and its ilk. Each user had the perpetual opporotunity to go up on stage into one of 5 dj spots(if there was an open one). You then selected the next track that would play for the entire room. No commercials. Tracks were selected form their impressive database, so no uploading or otherwise pulling music from the outside. As far as i knew, anyway. Sometimes the name of the current user matched the artist of the song, and people would (in the chat) definitely ask if it was them and it usually was. They were playing a new idea for opinions or revealing a new, finished piece that was still warm. Awesome. Did i say no commercials? Yeah they closed it down so they could focus fire on Turntable Live, it was more or less said.</br></br>    Superbad.com is a deceptively immersive symphony-blob of psychdelically interactive patterns and puzzles. Similar to the old hell.com, which was an epic puzzle to decend through its 9 layers, superbad.com gives you no indication whatsoever of anything even remotely approaching progress. This leaves the indication of "progress" to if you have seen the page it sent you to before or not. Often I've wondered if the flailing attempts I made to actually dictate my course mattered in the first place. For a long time, I just decided it was a random redirect within their vast index of absurd content whenever I was sent towards my next destination.</br></br></p>
