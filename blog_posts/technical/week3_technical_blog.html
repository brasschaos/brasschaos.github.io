<h2> Describing the popularity of JS in development today </h2>
<h4> by Jared_C </h4>
</div>

<div id="content_area">
	<p>Javascript, along with python, is one the more essential functions in web development. With the use of the console tab
	in chrome dev tools, productivity is made better due to the ability to better moniter and debug pages in the console.
	Aside from that, javascript has been used to craft tons of games and tools by developers. Sites like codecombat and, well,
	addictinggames.com/newgrounds.com and their ilk would not be possible without javascript. And if the people can't play bloons 2,
	god help us all. Actually, most of those games are flash. I meant the part where theyre organized so nicely, wait thats html and css.
	Well javascript is very important, in a behind the scenes kind of way. In fact, AG looks like its got its
	share on its page according to the console. Their global.min.css:1 is pretty cool too. One line? Either way, cheers.</p>
