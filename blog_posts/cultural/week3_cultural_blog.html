<h2>Describeing a Time I dealt with Conflict</h2>
<h4>by Jared_C</h4>
</div>

<div id="content_area">
	<p>Having dealt with a little conflict in my life, I can say it doesn't necessarily take two people to create one. This is the absolute antithesis of the post I had here previously, which I didn't even finish reading before I decided to re-write it.</p>
  <p>In my experience today even, internal conflict can take a heavy toll on one's ability to think clearly, and otherwise behave outside the way they prefer to conduct themselves. It wasn't even anything like, terrible that happened today, just  something that has happened enough times in front of me that its definitely a thing(that people do). Which is become irritated to strangers in times of unexpected hardship or stress. Particularly, when the stranger is behind a cash register, on the other side of a little protective shieldy window with a metal drawer.</p>
