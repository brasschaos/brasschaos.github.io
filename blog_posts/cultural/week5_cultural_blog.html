	<p>Hey, maybe not everyone wants to be a computer person. I mean, I'm into it, personally. I bet you are too, more or less. That is only going to go so far as far as maintaining the things that keep people alive. Electronics and the tech world can't farm us crops, yet. It can't produce things on par with the caliber of ingeunity that nature can. I mean, we can't 3d print carrots or lettuce or seeds, yet, nor can we bring extinct species back into the fold with the tech world. "Yet!", we say, as though we are so confident of our progress that we're already laughing about how its only a matter of time before we print out our kids ourselves.  </p>

The people who don't want to be computer people. In the world I have beheld people who don't belong anywhere near a computer. Not because they would be frustrated, confused or have trouble understanding their uses or purposes, but because they were more of an "outside" person. Even sitting at a table looked confining for them, to me. What I'm saying is that for the tech world to simply offer solutions within its design is not the type of solution that is going to ever be best for everyone in the world. We need to understand that they need their space too, and we can't turn the planet into<a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Coruscant">Coruscant</a>.</p>
