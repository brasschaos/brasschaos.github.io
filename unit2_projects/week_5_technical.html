<h2>Week 5: Classes</h2>

<div id="content_area">
	<p>Classes in ruby are a way of creating objects with methods available to them that are not available outside of the class. Using this technique, objects are given privilages and limitations specific to their purposes. For example, not allowing a sensitive piece of personal information to be modified from outside its class will prevent tempering, accidental data loss, or modification.</p>
	<p>Working with a customer's credit card number is a good example of sensitive information to keep away from being stored in a global variable, where it could be read or modified by anyone or anything outside of its explicit purpose in the program. Class variables are only accessable within its respective class. When checking an example card number using the luhn algorithm, setting the card's value to another private variable before beginning the process will prevent any permanent or unwelcome modification and access to the original number.</p>
