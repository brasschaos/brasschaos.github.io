<h2>Object Oriented Programming vs Functional Programming</h2>

</div>

<div id="content_area">
	<p>Object Oriented Programming is for primarily adding new data to existing methods</p>
	<p>Functional Programming is for primarily adding new ways to manipulate more seldom changing data</p>
	<p>Contrast of the two shows that of course a balance of the two is usually what emerges from a project's requirements.
		But again, primarily seems to be the key word, so whichever style benefits the project more greatly is more likely to be the overall approach taken.</p>
